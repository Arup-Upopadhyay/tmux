# tmux
For coders like me who spend most of our development time working with native gnome terminal, it becomes difficult to do context switch and screen split until you use terminator or ITerm. Using tmux enables us to achieve this without the need for any other 3rd party terminal.

PS: Please feel free to use it, and do send in PRs if you want to make improvements on it.
